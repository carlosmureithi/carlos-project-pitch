##Introduction to Data Visualization

Much has been reported about America’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and its deportation of Latin Americans over the past couple of years. The same can not be said of people from another part of the world: Africa. Yet these people have recently been major subjects of removal from the United States. In one such incident last December, 92 Somalis were put on a flight to Somalia for deportation (though, because of logistical issues, ICE said, the plane reached Senegal and returned to the US). As a result, I would like to look into ICE data to analyse the deportation of Africans from the United States and put this into perspective.

In January 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that seemingly intensified ICE activities. I would therefore like to find out what the trend has been in terms of the numbers of deportations of Africans from the US in the 15 years that ICE has been in existence and what effect Trump’s administration and executive order have been on this.

I intend to use data from the annual “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations” reports, which are available on the agency’s website. They have lists of the total number of people deported from each affected country for specific years.
Although ICE has been in existence for 15 years, I have only found records for the past three years (2015, 2016 and 2017). I intend to get the other data through a request to their public affairs office or through making a public records request through their website.

The questions I wish to address are: what has the trend in deportation been for Africans over the past 15 years, did this change in 2017, that is the year of Trump’s administration that ICE has released data on, if so how have different African countries been affected by this, what African countries have the most deportations, and what percentage of deportations Africa has had in comparison to other continents pre-Trump and during Trump’s administration.

I plan to visualise the data using maps of the world, a column histogram and a line chart.

The maps could have a sequential colour scheme to show increasing intensity, or colour saturation to indicate larger values. I could create one for each year then turn them into a GIF.

It could also be one interactive map with a sequential colour scheme and that is possible to show the deportation numbers over the years on a bar chart for a specific country when it is clicked on.

The column histogram would show the distribution of the total number of Africans deported over the 15 years.

A line chart with many categories – one for each continent – would show the comparison between the number of deportations of Africans with those of people from other continents over the 15 years.
